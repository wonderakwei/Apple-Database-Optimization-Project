## Case Study: Apple Inc.

### 1. Companyâ€™s Description

Apple Inc. is a renowned American multinational technology company founded in the 1970s by Steven Jobs. It specializes in designing, developing, and selling a wide range of consumer electronics, computer software, personal computers, smartphones, tablets, and online services. As a pioneer in the personal computer industry, Apple is recognized for popularizing the graphical user interface. The company's mission is to provide the best personal computing products and support to individuals and professionals worldwide, adapting to the dynamic landscape of the consumer electronics market.

### 2. Problem Statement

The demand for Apple products has surged during the global COVID-19 pandemic, leading to increased data stored in the company's database system. This has resulted in a decline in real-time performance for updating records, compounded by data redundancies, anomalies, and inconsistencies. The current database faces challenges during high traffic, particularly during online shopping events and product launches, causing delays, inaccuracies, and potential system shutdowns. To address these issues, a database redesign is imperative to enhance operational performance.
